    Given user "brand-new-user" has been created
    When the administrator changes the email of user "brand-new-user" to "brand-new-user@example.com" using the occ command
    Then the command should have been successful
    And the command output should contain the text 'The email address of brand-new-user updated to brand-new-user@example.com'
    And user "brand-new-user" should exist
    And the user attributes returned by the API should include
      | email | brand-new-user@example.com |

    Given user "brand-new-user" has been created
